Simple SMTP client - has all requirements implemented and working.
Signals are handled correctly - are cleaning memory also and ending connection.
Checked IPv4 and IPv6, different ports - all working and sending correctly.
Valgrind was cool in all cases - no leaks, I did the impossible - Valgrind was satisfied.
Program is checking all kinds of mistakes etc, has final state machine to check syntax of the input file.
Sample of usage:
----------------
IPv4 address:
./smtpklient -a 127.0.0.1 -p 25 -i inputFile.txt -w 2
IPv6 address:
./smtpklient -a ::1 -p 28 -i inputFile.txt -w 10
NonExistingFile
./smtpklient -i nonExistingFile
--> Error while opening file...
Print help:
./smtpklient -h
--> Print help...

All combinations should be OK.. did hard memory tests and hope fixed all bugs. Clean as lakatos's income.
